Soal:  
You are tasked with developing a small inventory management system for a bookstore. The system should be able to:
- Add new books to the inventory.
- Check if a book is already in the inventory.
- Remove books from the inventory.

### Requirements:
- Each book is identified by a unique ISBN (International Standard Book Number).
- The system should efficiently handle book additions, lookups, and deletions.
- Provide a brief description of how the chosen data structure supports these opera-
tions.

### Tasks:
1. **Write an Algorithm:** Outline a step-by-step algorithm to handle each of the tasks mentioned in the problem statement. Use pseudocode to represent the algorithm clearly.
2. **Choose a Data Structure:** Select an appropriate data structure to implement the inventory system. Justify your choice based on the efficiency of the operations (addition, lookup, removal).
3. **Explain Your Choice:** Provide a brief explanation of how the chosen data structure supports the operations required by the inventory management system and how it impacts performance.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your pseudocode along with an explanation of the chosen data structure.
- Ensure that your solution is clear, concise, and demonstrates an understanding of how data structures can optimize algorithm performance.
