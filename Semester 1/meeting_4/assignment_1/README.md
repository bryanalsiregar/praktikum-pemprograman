**Soal**

Write a program that calculates the sum of all natural numbers up to a given number n. The program should prompt the user for an integer input n and use
a for loop to compute the sum.

**Example**

```bash 
Input: 5
Output: Sum = 15
(Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)
```

**Hint** Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n and accumulate the sum.

**Required Files**

- **sum.cpp**: The C++ source code implementing the solution.
- **Makefile**: A makefile with the following functionalities:
    - Compile the program (make).
    - Run the program with user input (make run).
    - Clean the compiled files (make clean).
    - Test the program using test cases from test.txt (make test).
- **test.txt**: A file containing test cases in the format:
```bash
Input: <input_number>
Output: <expected_sum>
```
