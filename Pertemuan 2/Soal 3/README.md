Imagine I am your supervisor. Please write a test code for your previous two assignments to demonstrate that your solutions are working correctly.
### Requirements:
- ### Test for Payslip Calculation (from Problem 1):
    - Create test cases with different employee names gross salary percentages, fixed installments, and insurance amounts.
    - Ensure your test cases cover various scenarios, such as high and low gross salaries and different installment and insurance amounts.
    - Verify that the payslip output is correctly formatted and that the net salary is calculated accurately.
- ### Test for Quadratic Equation Solver (from Problem 2):
    - Create test cases with different values for coefficients a, b, and c.
    - Include scenarios where the discriminant (âˆ†) is positive, zero, and negative.
    - Ensure that your program correctly handles each case and outputs the correct roots or indicates that the roots are complex.

### Steps:
1. Write test code that includes various input values for both the payslip calculation and quadratic equation solver.
2. Run the test code and verify the results against expected outputs.
3. Document the results of your tests, including any discrepancies or issues found.
4. Submit your test code along with a brief report summarizing your test cases, results, and any findings.
